Notice that you can choose either "Installing on Local Machine" or "Deploying on AWS". You can choose first build cloud labeler on your local machine, make some changes, create your docker image and deploy it on AWS. However, "Installing on Local Machine" is **not** a prerequisite of "Deploying on AWS". We will provide existing docker image for easy use when deploying cloud labeler on AWS.

## Installing on Local Machine

### Requirements

Python 2 version 2.7+ or Python 3 version 3.5+

<details><summary markdown='span'>Want to use your own python?</summary>
<br />
    
If you need to use a different python, make sure to configure all the shebangs of python files. Shebang is a character sequence used to specify interpreter program in Unix-like operating systems. You can find the default shebang on the first line of all pythons files in /cgi-bin/ and /html/api/. For example, if you want to use python 3 and your python 3 is under '/usr/bin/python3', you need to change the shebang of all python files to '#!/usr/bin/python3' .
</details>

### Platforms

Cloud labeler has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04. For other versions of Ubuntu, you may need to do some configurations. For example, some operating system has a different Apache Web Root. You need to change the directory of your Apache Web Root in /cgi-bin/model.py so that it can find the data to read.

### Dependencies

* Apache2 (the version we have tested is 2.4.29)
* Sqlite3 (the version we have tested is 3.25.2)
* Pandas (the version we have tested is 0.23.4)

### Steps

1. Clone the cloud labeler package from GitHub.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/anhaidgroup/cloudlabeler.git
    ```

2. Copy or replace the /html and /cgi-bin folders in the Apache Web Root (usually /var/www/).

3. Enable cgi for both /cgi-bin/ and /html/api/ folders. You can learn how to enable cgi from https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/cgi.html. If you are using Ubuntu 18.04, you can replace /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and /etc/apache2/conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf using the [apache2.conf](./apache2.conf) and [serve-cgi-bin.conf](./serve-cgi-bin.conf) files we have provided.

4. Set the permission of every python file in /cgi-bin/ (including download.csv) and /html/api/ to be executable. Set the read and write access for all users to the files in /cgi-bin/data. For example, if your Apache Web Root is /var/www/, type:

    ```
    chmod -R 755 /var/www/cgi-bin
    chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/api
    chmod -R 666 /var/www/cgi-bin/data
    chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/data
    ```

5. Enable cgi and restart Apache2. You are all set.
    
    ```
    sudo a2enmod cgi
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ```
    
## Deploying on AWS

### Platforms

Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM)

### Dependencies

* Docker (the version we have tested is 18.06.1-ce)

In the approaches below, we will provide existing docker image for easy use. If you want to customize your docker image, we also prepare [deploy.sh](./deploy.sh) file to help you build your own docker image and [takedown.sh](takedown.sh) file to help you clean up the docker image later. You may need to create your [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) account and push your docker images so that you can access them later from AWS macine.

We offer two approaches to deploy cloud labeler on AWS. Approach 1 is to connect to your AWS machine directly and run docker image yourself. Approach 2 is to use Elastic Container Service, an advanced container orchestration service, to run docker image automatically. 

<details><summary markdown='span'>How can I know which approach to use?</summary> 
<br />
If you are unsure about which approach to choose, you can consider the following factors:
<br />
<br />
    
Use Approach 1 if you
* know how to connect to AWS machine using SSH.
* want to deploy cloud labeler quickly and easily.
* only have acccess to an existed EC2 instance but don't have permission to launch a new EC2 instance.

Use Appraoch 2 if you
* want to run cloud labeler in an existed ECS cluster.
* want to run cloud labeler at a high scalablility and performance.
* want to let different people manage cloud labeler and also ensure security.
</details>

### Approach 1

1. We use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), a secure cloud services platform, to deploy cloud labeler. If you don't have an AWS account, click [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) to create a new accout. 

      - After you have created your account, in [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) homapage, click "complete sign up" button at the top-right corner. You need to enter Email address and Password of your AWS account to sign up.
      - After you have signed up, in [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) homapage, the button at the top-right corner should display: "sign in the console". Click it and sign in your console. Now you are in your console page.

2. In your console page, you can find a panel named "AWS services" in the beginning which allows you to search for all AWS services. 
      
      - Search and enter [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), a cloud computing service, to help you deploy cloud labeler. Now, you should be in EC2 home page. 
      
      - EC2 provides instance, a cloud virtual machine, as server to deploy cloud labeler. To create EC2 instance, first find 'Instances' in the right panel of EC2 home page and click it. You are now in the EC2 instance page. 
      
      - Next, find and click on the blue botton 'Launch Instance' in the EC2 instance page. You are now in your EC2 instance configuration page.
   
      - Choose 'Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM)' as your Amazon Machine Image in "Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" of your EC2 instance configuration page. 
   
      - Choose General purpose Family t2.micro Type as your Instance Type if you want to use your free tier in "Step 2: Choose an Instance Type" of your EC2 instance configuration page.
      
      - For "Step 3: Configure Instance Details", "Step 4: Add Storage", "Step 5: Add Tags" in your EC2 instance configuration page, you can leave the options as default if you are unsure. 
   
      - In "Step 6: Configure Security Group" of your EC2 instance configuration page, you should include both 'SSH' and 'HTTP' to your security group. If you are unsure about whether you have included both, choose 'All Traffic' as the type of Security Group. Then, you need to specify IP address that has the permission to reach your EC2 instance in the Source in the Security Group. If you are unsure about Source in the Security Group, choose 'Anywhere'. 
      
      - In "Step 7: Review Instance Launch" of your EC2 instance configuration page, you can review all the configurations of your EC2 instance. After that, you can click "launch" button at the bottom-right corner of your EC2 instance configuration page.
   
      - After clicking 'Launch', you need to specify a key pair, which is a key that enables you to log into your instance later. If you already have your key pair, choose 'Choose a new key pair' in the first drop-down list, and select the key pair you want to use in the second drop-down list. If you don't have a key pair, choose 'Create a new key pair', enter your key pair name and download Key Pair. You need to save the Key Pair in a secure place in your local machine.
      
   <details><summary markdown='span'>Already have your deployed instance?</summary><br /> 
      If you want to deploy cloud labeler on an existed EC2 instance, click your instance in EC2 instance page and check its description shown below. 
   
      - Its AMI ID should include 'ubuntu-bionic-18.04'. 
   
      - In its Security groups, the inbound rules should include both 'SSH' and 'HTTP'. 
   
      - Otherwise, you need to launch a new instance.
 </details>

3. Connect to EC2 instance you just created using [SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html). You are now in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.


    <details><summary markdown='span'> Don't know how to connect to EC2 instance using SSH? </summary><br /> 
  
  
   If the system of your local machine is Linux or Mac,
  
   - In the end of step 1, you should download a Key Pair and it is a pem file. Set the permission of the pem file to be read only for the owner. For example, if your pem file is at /path/my-key-pair.pem, type:
   
   ```
   chmod 400 /path/my-key-pair.pem
   ```
   
   - Use ssh command in your local machine to connect to the EC2 instance. You need to specify your pem file location, user name and host name in your ssh command. The user name should be 'ubuntu'. You can find the host name of your EC2 instance by clicking your EC2 instance in EC2 instance page and check 'Public DNS (IPv4)' in its description below. For example, if your pem file is at /path/my-key-pair.pem and your Public DNS (IPv4) is ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com, type:
   
   ```
   ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ```
   
   - Type 'yes' when asked. You are now in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.
   
   If the system of your local machine is Windows, we recommend a convenient tool.
   
   - Download and install [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), an SSH and telnet clientï¼Œin your local machine.
     
   - In the end of step 1, you should download a Key Pair in your local machine and it is a pem file. Open 'Putty Key Generator' in your local machine and Load the Key Pair pem file in 'Load an existing private key file' section. Then, choose 'Save private key' and save Key Pair as ppk file in your local machine. 
   
   - Open Putty in your local machine and enter the 'Host name (or IP address)' in Putty. You can find the Host name of your AWS machine by clicking EC2 instance in EC2 instance page and check 'Public DNS (IPv4)' or 'IPv4 Public IP' in its description below. 
   
   - In the left panel of Putty in your local machine, choose Connection->SSH->Auth. In 'Private key file for authentication', choose the ppk file generated by 'Putty Key Generator' in your local machine.
   
   - Click 'Open' in the right bottom. You are now in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.
</details>
  
4. In the Command Shell of your EC2 instance, the first prompt should be 'login as'. Type 'ubuntu' in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.

5. Install Docker in your EC2 instance. You should type commands specified in [Docker installation tutorial]((https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)) in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.

6. After you have installed Docker in your EC2 instance, pull the image from Docker Hub by typing the following command in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.

    ```
    sudo docker pull zachary62/apache_labeler
    ```
   
    <details><summary markdown='span'> Using your own Docker image?</summary>
    <br />
  
    If you are using your own Docker image, you should pull it from your own Docker Hub. For example, if your Docker Hub repository name is John/apache_labeler, type:
   
     ```
    sudo docker pull John/apache_labeler
    ```
    </details>


7. Run the Docker image in your EC2 instance by typing the following command in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.

    ```
    sudo docker run -dit --name labeler -p 8080:80 zachary62/apache_labeler
    ```
    <details><summary markdown='span'> Using your own Docker image?</summary>
    <br /> 

    If you are using your own Docker image, you should use your own container name. For example, if your container name is John/apache_labeler, type
    
    ```
    sudo docker run -dit --name labeler -p 8080:80 John/apache_labeler
    ```
</details>

8. Now, you should be able to use cloud labeler. You can find the IP address of your EC2 instance by clicking the EC2 instance in EC2 instance page and check 'IPv4 Public IP' in its description below. Append ':8080' to your IPv4 Public IP. For example, if your 'IPv4 Public IP' is '1.2.3.4', you can visit cloud labeler in 'http://1.2.3.4:8080/' in your local machine (or any other machine whose IP address is included in the Source in the Security Group specified in step 3).
    
9. When you are done, you may need to remove the image and container in your EC2 instance. You should type the following command in the Command Shell of your EC2 instance.
    ```
    sudo docker stop labeler
    sudo docker rm labeler
    sudo docker rmi zachary62/apache_labeler
    ``` 
    <details><summary markdown='span'> Using your own Docker image?</summary>
    <br /> 
    
    If you are using your own Docker image, you should use your own image name. For example, if your container name is John/apache_labeler and image name is cloud_labeler, type
    ```
    sudo docker stop cloud_labeler
    sudo docker rm cloud_labeler
    sudo docker rmi John/apache_labeler
    ``` 
</details>


### Approach 2

1. Pull the image from Docker Hub on your local machine:

    ```
    sudo docker pull zachary62/apache_labeler
    ```
    
   (If you are using your own Docker image, you should pull from your own Docker Hub)

2. Install [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your local machine to help you push docker image. You can find the document for installation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html. 

3. [Configure your cgi and set keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) on your local machine so that it has access to your AWS account. If you aren't an IAM user, you need to first [Creating an IAM User and Group (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html).

4. [Create your repositories in AWS ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-create.html). Note that the name of repository should be 'apache_labeler' (or you will need to do more configurations to let docker identify your image). 

5. After you have created your repository, you should be able to find a 'View Push Commands' button in the repository page. Here it will list all the commands needed to push Docker image. Follow the commands carefully and push your Docker image to ECS repository. **Note: 1. you don't need to recreate docker image. 2. read the step 2 of push commands carefully**.

6. Create [Task Definition in AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html). You should use the url of the repository you have pushed as the container.

7. Create [Cluster in AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_clusters.html). The cluster template should be EC2 Linux and the Launch type should be EC2. 

8. After you have created a cluster, you should be able to create [service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in cluster page. Notice to choose the task you just created.
 
9. You should be able to find the deployed instances in [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Find 'instance' on the left panel and find the service you have just created. You can get the address of your instance directly in the IPv4 Public IP below. 

## User Manual

### Page Content

On the left side, there are three panels:

1. The top panel is Label Summary Panel. It shows a summary counts of different label types **saved**.

2. The middle panel is Filter Panel. It allows users to select a subset of label types and view or re-label them in the Main Panel. Users can select multiple label types. 

3. The bottom panel is Upload Panel. It allows users to upload and create their own tables.

Main Panel is on the right side. You can label and view tupe pairs for each pair. On the top there are three buttons. The 'Load Table' button allows you to load new table from database (and you should save current table before loading new one). The 'Download CSV' button allows you to download the CSV of current table. The 'Save and Continue' button allows you to save current table in database.

### Labeling

In order to label your own table, you need to follow the steps below:

First, upload your CSV files and choose your table name in Upload Panel.

Next, load the table you have uploaded using 'Load Table' button.

Then, label your pairs in the Main Panel. 

After that, save your table using 'Save and Continue' button. You can close the page and label the pairs later if you have saved the table.

Finally, download the final CSV file of the table you have saved using 'DownLoad CSV' button.

### Rest API

You can learn how to use REST api from [notebook](./notebooks/api.ipynb) (you need to install requests package).
